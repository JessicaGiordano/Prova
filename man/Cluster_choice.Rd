\arguments{
\item{database}{The matrix generated by the creazionedati function.}

\item{K}{A vector with the cluster that you want consider.}

\item{H}{A vector with the space dimensions h that you want consider.}
}
\value{
The matrixes in which are stored the AIC and Bic values for each model,
        and a list with the output of the Functional Clustering with the different inputs.
