\title{Overall clusters betweenness}
\usage{
Betweenness(ClustCurve, MeanCurves)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClustCurve}{A data frame with 5 arguments : time, volume, ID, cluster membership and feature values for each curves.}

\item{MeanCurves}{A matrix with the meancurves on the columns according to different clusters.}
}
\value{
A list with 4 arguments (if "centroids" equals TRUE): Betweenness is a matrix with 2 columns, the minimum cluster distance and the cluster name that achieves the minimum;
                                                              CentroidDist is a K x K matrix (where K is the cluster number) containing centroids cluster distance among each cluster couple;
                                                              Classes a vector containing the cluster name membership for each dataset curve.

Betweenness across all clusters is computed
