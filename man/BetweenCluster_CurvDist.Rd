\title{i-th cluster betweenness}
\usage{
BetweenCluster_CurvDist(ClustCurve, i)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClustCurve}{A data frame with 5 arguments : time, volume, ID, cluster membership and feature values for each curves.}

\item{i}{a numeric value for the cluster involved in withinness computation}
}
\value{
a list with 4 arguments: CurveDistance is matrix for each curve hausdorff distance from each i-th cluster curves;
Between is a matrix for minimum and maximum hausdorff distance of i-th cluster curves from the other clusters;
NearCurveID and FarCurveID are the nearest and the farthest dataset curves from the i-th cluster.
}
\description{
Hausdorff distance between i-th cluster meancurve and other clusters meancurves
