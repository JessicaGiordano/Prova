\usage{
clustering(databaseTr, k, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{databaseTr}{List containing the number of observations per each curve (called LenCurv),
and a data frame constituted from the curves' ID, observed values and the respective times,
that might be truncated at a specific time or not.
It is generated automatically from the function DataImport() or DataTruncation() if we want consider
a truncation time.}

\item{k}{Number of clusters, it could be a vector.}

\item{model}{String model name, it is possible to choose one among Malthus, Gompertz and Logistic models.}
}
\value{
List containing, for each curve, the parameters of the fitting with respect of the model choosen,
        the center and the cluster of affinity.
}
\description{
The function clustering() fits and clusterize the data stored in databaseTr with a model among
the Malthus, Gompertz and Logistic ones.
