and a data frame constituted from the curves' ID, observed values and the respective times.
It is generated automatically from the function DataImport().}

\item{feature}{String feature name, stored in the target file, to plot curves according to.}

\item{save}{When TRUE (the default is FALSE), it is possible to save a plot that compares the density time grid and
the growth curves plot in a pdf.}

\item{path}{Path to save plot to (combined with filename).}
}
\value{
alldata list DataImport() output with feature color palette.
