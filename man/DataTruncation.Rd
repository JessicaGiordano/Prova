\title{DataTruncation() is a function used with the purpose to truncate the data at a specific time in according
to the density time grid and the growth curves plot.}
\usage{
DataTruncation(alldata, feature, truncTime = NULL, save = FALSE,
  path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{alldata}{A list with 4 arguments : the DataStruncture() output list.}

\item{feature}{A character string for a target file feature name to investigate across curves.}

\item{truncTime}{An integer corresponding to the time at which truncate the curves. (TimeGridDensity() output suggests suitable candidates).}

\item{save}{A logical value. If "save" equals TRUE truncated growth curves plot is saved in a pdf file (the default is FALSE).}

\item{path}{A character string for saving plot path folder .If "save" is TRUE and "path" is missing, the plot is saved in the current directory.}
}
\value{
The growth curves plot with a bar at the truncation time and a list with 4 arguments: a data frame with 3 variables (ID curves, volume and time values
        truncated at the truncation time), a vector for truncated curves lengths,a data frame with curves labeled according to target file feature chosen and a vector for overall truncated time grid.
        If "save" equals TRUE, a pdf file containing the plot is returned too.
