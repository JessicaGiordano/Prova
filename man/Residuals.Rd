\title{Calculate residuals, quadratic residuals and the curves fitted both in the observation times and
in the grid, that is the union of times of the all curves. It could be done for three models:
Malthus, Gompertz and Logistic.}
\usage{
Residuals(model, time, Vol, par, plot)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Vector of the all time for the different curves.}

\item{Vol}{Vector of observations.}

\item{par}{Vector of the parameters estimed for the respective model.}

\item{plot}{If it is "TRUE" then it will be shown a plot od the residuals, an histogram and a qqplot.}

\item{Model}{It is the name of the model among Malthus, Gompertz and Logistic that will be used.}
}
\value{
A list in which is stored the residuals, quadratic residuals, the curve fitted in both the
observation times and all times.
