\title{PCA Analysis}
\usage{
PCA.Analysis(data.matrix, save = FALSE, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.matrix}{Matrix with 3 columns: curve ID, volume and time measures.}

\item{save}{When TRUE (the default is FALSE), it is possible to save a plot that compares the density time grid and
the growth curves plot in a pdf.}

\item{path}{Path to save plot to (combined with filename).}
}
\value{
List containing the plot of the variances against the number of the principal component and
        the vector of percentages.
}
\description{
PCAbarplot() is used to choice the dimension of the cluster mean space, h.
The PCA method performs an accurate analysis to determine whether the means lie in a lower
dimensional space, note that if h is equal to the number of cluster menus one, does not produce restriction on the mean
space.
To estimate h the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the spline coefficients provided
for each curves by the functional clustering model.
It generates a bar plot indicating with how much percentage the principal components explain
the variability in the data.
Usually the components are choosen if the sum of the respective percentages is greater than 95 percent.
