}
\arguments{
\item{ClustCurve}{A data frame with 5 arguments : time, volume, ID, cluster membership and feature values for each curves.}

\item{MeanCurves}{A matrix with the meancurves on the columns according to different clusters.}

\item{i}{a numeric value for the cluster involved in withinness computation}
}
\value{
withmean.i a numeric vector for i-th cluster curves hausdorff distance from the corresponding meancurve
}
\description{
Hausdorff distance between curves belonging to the i-th cluster and corresponding meancurve is computed
}
