\title{Overall Clusters withinness}
\usage{
Withinness(ClustCurve, MeanCurves, centroids = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClustCurve}{A data frame with 5 arguments : time, volume, ID, cluster membership and feature values for each curves.}

\item{MeanCurves}{A matrix with the meancurves on the columns according to different clusters.}

\item{centroids}{A logical value for specifying how to compute withinness. If "centroids" equals TRUE (default value), WithCluster_MeanDist() function is used, otherwise withinness is calculated using WithCluster_CurvDist().}
}
\value{
withinness a numeric matrix with 4 columns: mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum withinness distance across distinct clusters.
}
\description{
Withinness across all clusters is computed
}
